Web Application - Deployment and Local Setup Guide

Project Overview

This is a web application designed to [provide an overview of what your application does, e.g., "manage portfolios," "track attendance," or "connect users to stress relief resources"]. The project utilizes the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) and has been successfully deployed with:

Frontend: Hosted on Netlify.

Backend: Hosted on Render.

Database: MongoDB Atlas.

Features

[List the main features of your application, e.g., "User Authentication," "Dynamic Dashboard," "Portfolio Tracking," etc.]

Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed:

Node.js (version 14 or later)

npm or yarn

MongoDB (if running locally)

Git

Steps to Run the Project Locally

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

2. Set Up the Backend

Navigate to the backend directory:

cd backend

Install dependencies:

npm install

Create a .env file in the backend directory and add the following:

PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

Start the backend server:

npm start

3. Set Up the Frontend

Navigate to the frontend directory:

cd ../frontend

Install dependencies:

npm install

Create a .env file in the frontend directory and add the following:

REACT_APP_Backend_Url=http://localhost:5000

Start the React development server:

npm start

Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:3000

Assumptions

The user has basic knowledge of Git and Node.js.

The MongoDB cluster is pre-configured for external access.

API keys and sensitive credentials are stored securely in the .env file and are not committed to the repository.

Limitations

Performance:

The application may face performance issues with large datasets.

Error Handling:

Limited error handling for edge cases.

Authentication:

Token expiration may not be handled dynamically in some cases.

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):

May require adjustments for specific deployment setups.

Future Enhancements

Add role-based access controls.

Optimize API performance.

Improve frontend responsiveness for mobile devices.

Add integration tests to enhance code coverage.
